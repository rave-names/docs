# Get A Name

Pre-requesites:
 - A web3 wallet connected to Fantom ([tutorial](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-add-fantom-to-metamask))
 - At least 5.5 FTM in your wallet ([bridge](https://synapseprotocol.com), [swap](https://app.paraswap.io/#/?network=fantom)) 

## How to register a name
It's pretty self-explanitory, but I'll walk you through it.

1. Navigate to [rave.domains](https://rave.domains)
2. Click 'Go to app' in the top-right to get to the dApp
3. You should now be prompted with a search bar
4. Type in the name you want, and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
5. If there is a 'Register' button like this one, you can register that name, if not, search for another and try again!

<button style={{"borderRadius":"17px","height":"calc(9.75vh)","marginTop":"1.25vh","border":"none","backgroundImage":"linear-gradient(330deg, rgb(3, 4, 94), rgb(0, 150, 199))","width":"20vw","cursor":"pointer","marginLeft":"2vh"}}><p style={{"color":"rgb(15, 255, 240)","fontFamily":"Arial","fontSize":"22px", "marginTop": "2.5vh"}}>Register name.ftm</p></button>
