# Create a dSite
dSites are decentralised websites. For a decentralised website, you need a decentralised domain! By using our [ftm.rip](https://ftm.rip) gateway service, you can host your website on a .ftm site!

We wrote a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rave_names/status/1578964871177084928) about how to do this, so read the instructions there on hosting a website.
